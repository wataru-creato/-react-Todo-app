# 📝 Todo List App (react版)

このwebアプリは，reactを学習後，TodoアプリのJavescript版(https://github.com/wataru-creato/Todo-app)を基に再度作成したものである．
おもにReactをメインにJavesctiptを使用した．
localStorageは引き続き，フレームワークとしてTailwindCSSを使用して学ぶことができた．

## 使用技術
- JavaScript (ES6)
- React (関数コンポーネント、Hooks)
- CSS / TailwindCSS
- ブラウザの LocalStorage を使用したデータ保存

## ✨ 主な機能

- ✅ タスクの追加  
- ❌ タスクの削除  
- ✔️ 完了済みタスクのチェック  
- 💾 localStorage による保存  
- 🗨  色の状態ごとにタスクを絞り込む

## 🚀 デモ



# Todoリスト開発で学んだこと

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
